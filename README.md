# dotnet-core-utils

This package provides some Entity Framework Core repository base classes to help with data access.  One is a base repository that helps to manage repository logic related to an entity where you'll be writing all the data access methods yourself.  The other class is a CRUD repository that provides base Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods for an entity.
